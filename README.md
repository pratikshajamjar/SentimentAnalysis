This Streamlit web application provides an interactive platform for performing sentiment analysis on user-generated content using a fine-tuned BERT model (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english). It offers three core functionalities: analyzing individual comments, processing uploaded CSV files containing multiple comments, and fetching & analyzing comments from a YouTube channel using the YouTube Data API. The model is enhanced with custom rules to detect sentiment from emojis and certain phrases, making the analysis more context-aware. Visualizations using matplotlib provide quick insights into sentiment and spam distributions.

The "Single" mode lets users test comments one at a time, while the "Browse" mode allows batch processing of labeled datasets (containing CONTENT and CLASS columns) to detect both sentiment and spam. The "YouTube" mode fetches the latest comments from a given channel, enabling real-time analysis of audience feedback. The application is easy to run locally, requiring standard Python packages like streamlit, transformers, and google-api-python-client. This tool is ideal for creators, educators, and data enthusiasts looking to monitor or explore sentiment in user feedback across different platforms.
